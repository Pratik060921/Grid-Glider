This project is a comprehensive implementation of the classic Snake game, built from the ground up and expanded with numerous advanced features. It began as a simple C++ console application and evolved into a full-featured, installable Progressive Web App (PWA) with multiple game modes, unlockable themes, and a global online leaderboard.

It includes:

Three Game Modes: Classic, Hurdles, and Time Attack.

Advanced Gameplay: Power-ups, moving enemies, and a score-multiplying combo system.

Customization: Unlockable visual themes like "Tron" and "Jungle."

Online Leaderboard: A global, real-time high-score system powered by Firebase Firestore.

Modern Tech: Fully responsive, mobile-ready with touch controls, and installable as an offline-first PWA.
